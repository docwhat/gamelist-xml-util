    <name>1943 Kai</name>
    <desc>This is an enhanced version of 1943: The Battle of Midway, with most of the graphics and sounds reworked. There are also changes in the weapons and the inclusion of anachronical items such as laser-firing WWII planes and ships that run on ground. The player controls a biplane Boeing Stearman E75 N68828 instead of the P-38. 
 
The PC Engine adaptation adds some original levels to those from the arcade version, as well as animated intermissions.</desc>

    <name>21 Emon : Mezase Hotel Ou!!</name>
    <desc>Naturally a manga/TV anime tie-in, 21 Emon is one of those Japanese style board games that have never really made a big impact in the west. Four players (any combination of human and computer) take it in turns to roll dice and move around the isometric board, landing on various event squares. The ultimate aim is to build as many hotels as you can and make more loot than your opponents.

    <desc>Air Buster is a fast side-scrolling shooter. The player controls a small craft through different levels with many enemies. Every level ends with a boss and some sections speed up the gameplay, offering fast obstacle courses both horizontally and vertically scrolling. Flying orange pods release many power-ups at once, enhancing the ships with new or more powerful lasers, wing men and shields. The player can also hold the fire key to charge a blast that removes all enemy bullets from the screen and deals damage to all enemies. With an unforgiving difficulty, every hit is fatal, but the game can be continued from any point as long as there are lives and credits left. The game can be played with two players cooperatively.</desc>

    <name>After Burner II</name>
    <desc>Similar to its predecessor, the premise of After Burner II is to get on the F-14 Tomcat and fly mission after mission of shooting planes out of the sky. At your disposal is a vulcan cannon (basically a machine gun) and a limited number of missiles. In some versions of the game the guns fire automatically all the time. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. You also can speed up and slow down to deal with enemies which appear behind you.</desc>

    <desc>The Axe is back... with twice the force and twice the fury of 1989's "Videogame of the Year"! This time it's brother against brother locked in deadly combat. Your older brother has summoned unspeakable forces of evil to take control of the kingdom. Treachery rules! Your only hope is the legendary royal sword! But will its power be enough to overcome the Cliffs of Chaos? The Skull Dungeons? And the treacherous Crypts of Slime? Only your courage, your fighting skill, and the Legendary Axe can answer! 
 
This game has you fighting monsters through seven stages with just a sword, but three other weapons can be picked up along the way, and include axes, chain spears, and smart bombs. These weapons can only be obtained by collecting the power-up that a defeated enemy leaves behind. Weapons can be switched along the way. At the end of each level, you must defeat a huge boss in order to go to the next stage.</desc>

    <name>Aoi Blink</name>
    <desc>Aoi Blink is a side-scrolling platformer based on the TV anime series of the same name. The five levels are similarly built as the ones in Super Mario Bros. 3: they are divided into various areas which are reached through a map screen with branching paths. Those areas need to be solved to be able to walk further on the map.  
 
The speciality of this game is that the player can switch between three characters with different abilities on the fly, e.g. one can jump high and another has a better gun. Those are important to be able to solve the challenges the levels bring, mostly consisting of traditional platforming and avoiding/shooting enemies.  However, the boss area at the end of the level map has to be opened with a master key. There is one hidden in every area. 
 
The three characters are based on characters of the series and change depending on the level. The health pool is shared between all characters and losing all hearts results in losing a life. Hearts can be refilled by collecting money which is left behind by killed enemies.</desc>

    <desc>Artist Tool is a basic art creation program for the PC Engine developed by Hudson. It is operated by a drawing tablet peripheral named the "Illust Booster", which allowed users to draw directly onto the screen with a stylus similar to the art tablets of today, and another peripheral the "Print Booster", which allowed users to print their on-screen creations to paper as well the "Photo Reader" which worked as an image scanner. As well as a basic set of drawing tools, the player could switch between three music tracks to listen to as they worked. The game is a particularly rare and thus valuable HuCard to collectors, due to the number of equally rare and pricey peripherals that were sold along with it. Both the game and the peripherals command high prices on auction sites.</desc>

    <desc>Atomic Robo-Kid Special is a PC Engine adaptation of Atomic Robo-Kid, originally released by UPL for the Arcade in 1988. Unlike the versions released for other systems, which were all straight Arcade conversions, the PC Engine was rebuilt from scratch and thus carries the "Special" modifier in its title.The PC Engine version would never be released outside of Japan. GameplayAs with the standard Atomic Robo-Kid, the eponymous robotic war machine passes through a series of stages to find the exit. Each exit is blocked by a boss enemy, which often needs to be destroyed before the exit becomes accessible. Atomic Robo-Kid can collect up to three weapon upgrades and switch between them: if they lose a life, they lose the presently equipped upgrade but keep the others.The game will switch up how each stage is presented. The first two stages are side-scrollers, while others include a single-screen "duel" with a rival, a maze-like stage that the player explores in various directions and other divergences.</desc>

    <name>Batman</name>
    <desc>The TurboGrafx-16 version of Batman: The Video Game is a top-down maze-like game, somewhat similar to Pac-Man or Bomberman. 
 
The game consists of five stages based on the movie: the Streets of Gotham, Flugelheim Museum, AXIS Chemical Factory, the Parade and the Cathedral, where Batman finally faces the Joker. The first four stages are divided into 12 sub-stages or mazes. Each main level has its own objective, which basically consists of finding items in the mazes: collecting "smilex" components in the streets of Gotham, cleaning paintings at the museum, planting bombs at the factory and cutting off the ropes of Joker's balloons at the parade. Before each level, a cutscene with scenes from the movie is displayed. 
 
Batman can attack his enemies with his Batarang. Through the levels, he will collect items which will upgrade his speed and give his Batarang a longer range and multiple shots.</desc>

Unfortunately, this does not defeat the enemies, only disables them for a short time. After a few seconds, the enemies respawn and resume their chase of the player.

The five-player option was new to any incarnation of Lode Runner, and operates in a very similar manner to Bomberman, except with hole drilling instead of bombing.</desc>

    <desc>Chew Man Fu has set a curse to rob the world of fried rice, egg rolls and all its other favourite foods. To stop him you must work through 550 rounds, clearing them by placing four different coloured balls into the appropriately-coloured hole.

Gameplay is something of a Pengo variant, as the single-screen levels are inhabited by enemies, who can be killed by firing one of the balls at them at speed. When it hits one it will continue moving in the same direction, rebounding off walls if neccessary, and pushing you backwards slightly if it comes back to you - but it can be instantaneously brought back under control. Blocks can also be moved at a more casual speed, including round corners. Once a block is placed onto its spot, it can be used again as a weapon. The levels are in a maze style, and parts of this can be opened up. The game also includes a small bonus Kick-Ball game for 2 players, which doubles as practice with the control system.</desc>

    <name>Benkei Gaiden</name>
    <desc>For many years, monsters have been terrorizing the peaceful lands, until finally, the Buddhist priests known as the Dharma Eyes found a safe heaven in a secluded temple, where they raised young martial artists who would eventually liberate the people from the monsters. One day, one of these disciples was kidnapped by monsters and taken into their tower. The current Dharma Eye instructs another disciple, named Oniwaka, to venture towards the tower to the south and find a way to rescue his friend... and perhaps finally put an end to the monster invasion. 
 
Benkei Gaiden is a traditional Japanese-style RPG, set in an environment reminiscent of Japan of the feudal epoch, with supernatural elements such as monsters etc. The player navigates Oniwaka on the top-down map, visiting towns, buying equipment (weapons and armor), and fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Obviously, the game has been heavily influenced by the early  Dragon Quest games; the interaction menu is nearly identical (the player has to bring up a menu and choose verb commands such as "Talk" or "Search", rather than perform different actions simply by pressing a button), and the general gameplay system does not deviate from the classic formula.</desc>

    <desc>Eleven years have gone by since Tom-Tom rescued his girlfriend Tanya from the clutches of the evil King. Word of Tom-Tom's dangerous adventure soon spread throughout Wonder Land. The people were very proud of him and gave Tom-Tom the highest honor of all - the legendary name of Wonder Boy. With the evil King defeated, Wonder Land returned to its peaceful state, and for over one decade, the kingdom was a paradise, and everything and everyone lived happily together.

Eventually, the peace was broken when a ferocious fire-breathing dragon appeared out of nowhere and took over Wonder Land with an army of evil, monsterous henchmen, causing Wonder Land was immediately thrown into utter chaos. Defenseless that they were, the people were quickly taken over and the tranquil and serene kingdom was transformed into a land of demons and devils. Wonder Land was now a Monster Land. Tom-Tom was summoned to set out on a journey, destroy this dragon, and restore peace once again. Tom-Tom is Wonder Land's last hope.

There are twelve locations in which Tom-Tom must venture through, including (but not limited to): the city of Wonder Land, Valley of Peace, The Coastal Town of Baraboro, The Mam Desert, and Pororo Islands. During his journey, he must defeat monsters with the sword that he got at the beginning of his adventure. These monsters will leave either gold coins or bags of cash, which he can use to buy better weapons, shields, armors, and boots. At the end of each location, there is usually a boss that Tom-Tom must defeat in order to obtain a gold key that will unlock the exit gate, as well as plenty of gold coins or bags of cash. If he touches any enemies, or is shot at, he will lose health. During his travels, Tom-Tom must take note of the hourglass; if the hourglass display sands at the bottom, he must get another one that appears out of nowhere, or he'll also lose health. There are two ways in which he can restore it. He can either go into bars to have a drink that will restore it and get a hint about what lies ahead as well, or go into hospitals and heal himself to restore the lost health. </desc>

    <desc>The concept behind Blodia is very simple: 1-You have a screen of pipe-work. 2-There is a ball travelling down the pipe. 3-If the ball drops down a gap in the pipe you have to start again. That's it. So what this all amounts to is you frantically sliding the tiles around block-puzzle style to keep that cursed ball bearing on track. God forbid that you think the ball is moving too slowly, you can even push a button to speed the damn thing up, but you have to wonder why you would ever want to do that.</desc>

    <path>./Body Conquest II (Japan).pce</path>
    <name>Bodycon Quest II</name>
    <desc>The story of this game is rather simple: the world is in peril, as the evil witch Topaz sends her seductive minions to terrorize the wilderness, plotting to overthrow the rightful king and conquer the world. A young prince is born, who is destined to be the one who slays Topaz. His first quest is to retrieve a magical armor which is essential for the victory. But the evil sexy female demons will do everything in their powers to stop the hero... 
 
Bodyconquest II is in many ways a homage to the first  Dragon Quest game. The gameplay is nearly identical: the lone hero fights randomly appearing enemies in one-on-one battles, gains experience and money, gradually levels up, waits until he can afford better weapons and armor and venture into an area with stronger monsters, etc. Even the menu with commands such as "Talk" and "Search" is copied almost verbatim from the father of Japanese RPGs. 
 
The one distinguishing feature of this game is the sex appeal of the enemies. They are young, female, and tend to wear less than what we would usually associate with the medieval codex of modesty.  
 
Scantily clad girls, suggestive poses, and sexual innuendo abound; but no explicit scenes which would warrant an adult rating.</desc>

    <desc>Never one to leave a good thing to be forgotten, Hudson are back with the third installment of the ever present Bomber Man series, and with this one comes a few changes. Apart from our dumpy little hero having lost a little weight since '93, the gameplay has also been altered significantly. While still retaining the basic bombing action, completing a level now no longer requires you to destroy all enemies on screen. Instead, you have to find and destroy a set of pillars on each level and these will unlock a broken piece of amulet from its protected dome. Collect the piece and all remaining destructible blocks turn into coins and you have about 15 seconds to collect as many as possible. Another major addition is kangaroo-type animals that you can jump on and ride. These have special abilities, like jumping and such and also count as an extra hit in case you walk into an enemy or stupidly blow yourself up.</desc>

    <desc>The black spaceman kidnapped your beloved and brought her to his chambers in the castle, far beyond your reach, over the rivers, forest and mountains. Your job is to save her, battling the sea of the enemies, with only bombs at your disposal.

The range of explosion can be upgraded with time, but if you die, the range resets to minimum and you loose your previous skills, though. Some updates can make you walk through the walls, increase your speed, and give you some other assets to aid you in your quest to save the woman you love.

This top-down action-arcade game consists of nine levels per stage, each tougher than the other, and each final consisting of the boss you'll have to deal with. You can move horizontally and vertically and lay down bombs behind you thus evaporating the enemies, but beware, 'cos you can block yourself with your own bomb, and become a victim of your own tricks if you'll play in a huff.</desc>

    <name>Bull Fight : Ring no Hasha</name>
    <desc>Bullfight: Ring no Hasha is a boxing game in which the player takes part in a competition with eight boxers. The tournament consists of four fights and a finale and each boxer can be controlled by a human player. The boxers have different statistics (strength, agility and endurance) which can be improved between fights with a training fight. Each boxer has four moves (left swing, right swing, uppercut and dodge) and a hit both depletes the opponent's energy bar and gives points. Similar to real boxing, those points are used to determine the winner if no boxer is knocked out during the regular rounds. A knockout happens when the energy runs out, but when the player mashes a button fast enough when the boxer is given a count, he stands up again with a partly replenished energy bar.  
 
Additionally there is also a side-scrolling fighting game included. Here the player walks from left to right and fights enemies in martial arts melee combat.</desc>

Cadash is a platform action role-playing game.

The protagonist fights his or her way through dungeons, attacking physically or casting spells (as priestess or mage). Like in regular platform games, there are places where the player character is required to jump, duck, or climb. The protagonist gains experience for defeating monsters, and their level rises in a true RPG fashion.</desc>

    <name>Columns</name>
    <desc>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.

As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</desc>

    <desc>Cyber-Core is a vertically scrolling shooter in which the player fights insects. The basic idea is traditional: shooting everything before they can shoot/touch the player: after three hits the chitin armor breaks and a life is lost. Besides flying enemies which are disposed of with the standard gun, the player also has to deal with enemies on the ground which need to be hit with one of the unlimited bomb.</desc>

    <name>Cyber Knight</name>
    <desc>In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.

Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.

Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.</desc>

People who just couldn't get enough of Darius could now play another variation on the same theme. Darius Alpha is built on the same codebase as Darius Plus, but has been remodeled into a so-called "boss-fight" game, e.g. a game where you only fight the bosses of a game or game series. You start out with an unequipped ship and must take down the boss of the first level, King Fossil. Upon defeating King Fossil, you are granted some slight upgrades and proceed directly to the boss of the next level. And so on.</desc>

Fortunately, the A.N.G.E.L. is helped on its way by a number of power-ups - for instance, Healing Power completely repairs the sub and Speed Power speeds it up. Up to three modes of attack can be used to combat the mutant fish - the starting Pulse Shot, the destructive Swirl Cutter, and the Bubble Beam. But the A.N.G.E.L. is not indestructible. Four colors on the A.N.G.E.L.'s eye indicate the amount of damage the sub has sustained, and when it's had enough and explodes, that's the end of the A.N.G.E.L. and the end of the game.</desc>

You must collect all of the keys on the stage to open the exit door while avoiding or eliminating enemies. Your primary method of dealing with enemies is to dig holes; if an enemy walks into a hole, they are momentarily trapped and you can then fill the hole to kill the enemy. 
 
You can also obtain temporary weapon powerups such as rayguns and yo-yos, as well as extend your digging reach to dig multiple holes at once. There are also several bosses encountered throughout the game. 
 
The Japanese release, Doraemon: Meikyu Daisakusen, features popular children's character Doraemon and his friends. The game is a conversion of the 1987 Nichibutsu coin-op Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen, which also saw a modified Famicom version called Booby Kids.</desc>

    <path>./Double Dungeons - W (Japan).pce</path>
    <name>Double Dungeons</name>
    <desc>Double Dungeons is a solo dungeon crawler in the strictest sense. One or two players can explore pseudo-3D, maze-like dungeons (without auto-map feature, but with directions displayed on the screen) and fight the monsters populating them. The player(s) can choose to venture into any of the available 20 dungeons. The dungeons have the same textures, but their layout varies; the higher is the number of the chosen dungeon, the more dangerous are its enemies. Two-player mode features a split screen; the two players start exploring the dungeon from different points.

The basic gameplay is very simple. Enemies appear at specific points (they can also re-spawn), and must be defeated in order to proceed. The combat is turn-based at its core, though the turns follow very quickly, and the enemies will attack even if the player does nothing. Attacking is done simply by pressing a button; there are no other combat options. 

The player can find equipment and healing items (which can also be dropped by enemies). These can be used to restore the player character's HP outside of battles. Leveling up is completely automatic.

There is no narrative in the game; the only story-related information comes in form of very short text intros to the different dungeons, along the lines of "the king wants to retrieve a treasure and sends a warrior into the dungeon" or comparable mission objectives.</desc>

    <desc>This is a remake of the original game. The story still's the same: Ishtar sends Gilgamesh up the 60 maze levels of the Druaga's tower to rescue Ki and retrieve the Blue Crystal Rod. He must find each level's key to proceed to the next one.

Besides the updated graphics, this remake features a 3/4 view instead of the original top-down one. It also bears some RPG elements, as Gilgamesh gathers experience points for killing enemies, which are spent at the end of each level, to improve his stats (such as speed, health, etc.). He'll also find equipment such as swords, helmets, armors, shields, gauntlets and boots, which can be changed to better his stats, and will also find special items in hidden chests. The way to find theses chests is different for each floor. There are new treasures and new enemies.

The game also features four different difficulty levels (easy, normal, hard and pro), as well as a password feature.</desc>

    <desc>The former king of Oddesia has entrusted you with an important, dangerous task. You must find the sacred ORA stone, which possesses the powers of life, light and happiness, and retrieve it before the king of the alien race, Natas, does. He has conquered this land and plunged it into an age of terror and despair, plagued with violence. It is up to you to stand against him and return your world to its former glory.

Dungeon Explorer plays like Gauntlet: you choose one of several different characters to play as (Fighter, Thief, Warlock,  Witch, Bard, Bishop, Elf and Knome) and set out on your adventure alone or with up to four other players. Battles are real-time and of the shooter variety, ie, rather than swing a sword, you fire knives (or spells depending on your class). Enemies respawn out of holes in the ground which must be eradicated to keep them from pouring forth in waves. There are a number of items to be found and used throughout the game including potions of white and black magic, healing drinks and the like, but unlike Gauntlet there is no food to worry about.</desc>

    <desc>The story of this game is rather simple: Tokyo has been destroyed by monsters! Terrifying creatures have invaded the city and ruined it. A scientist who possesses the secret knowledge of psychic powers known as ESP, imbues a young boy with them, and sends him to the streets and underground caverns of Tokyo, to rescue the few remaining survivors, and find out the source of the monstrous invasion!

Energy is a side-scrolling shooter. The player manipulates the young hero, who can shoot energy balls and jump. The energy attacks deplete his ESP bar, which refills itself gradually afterwards. The hero's life bar can only be refilled with healing potions which are sometimes dropped by the enemies. The boy can also collect items which change the properties or his ESP attack, and/or upgrade these attacks to the next level.</desc>

The World Championship mode has of course returned, though the managerial Constructors mode is no longer present. There is also a Free Attack mode, where any course can be freely practiced; a Training mode, where special training courses can be raced on to learn the ins and outs of the game; and a Watch mode, where the player can choose a course and watch a demonstration race. </desc>

    <desc>Fighting Run is an action game by Nihon Bussan that features an unusual mix of racing and fighting. The player takes control of a humanoid biped robot engaged in a series of deadly races against other opponents. But these races have a twist - each racer can attack the opposing player in order to win the race and score points. In single-player mode, the player first needs to choose a track and an opponent. Then points need to be allocated to increase various abilities, from Speed, Power to Armor. Then the race is ready to go - each racer can freely move around the track, hit each other or use special attacks collected along the way (such as lightning bolts, grenades and so forth). Each robot also comes with a life bar and the race is over as soon as it reaches zero. Additionally, Fighting Run features a versus-mode where two players, or two AI controlled opponents, can race against each other, as well as a tournament-mode where eight robots and their pilots race (two at the time) for a golden trophy.</desc>

The game features two power ups which are represented with different colours: weapon upgrades and drones which accompany the player. Those can be upgraded twice each and are compatible to each other. If the player dies, the extras are evacuated into a green capsule. It can be then picked up when using the next life.</desc>

There are two basic modes: Grand Prix and Quest.  Grand Prix consists of a multi-race points championship.  There are two car types for this mode: F-3000 and F1.  Grand Prix mode can be played with one or two players.

Quest mode has more depth and forms the core of Final Lap Twin.  This is essentially a racing RPG.  You take the role of a boy who desires to become the World Champion.  To do so, you must travel from town to town finding challenges and winning them to gain money and special items to improve your car.  As you move around the game world, which is presented in an overhead view, you will encounter random challenges, much like random battles in a traditional RPG.</desc>

    <name>Gaia no Monshou</name>
    <desc>Gaia no Monsh? (also known as the 'Crest of Gaia') is a fantasy round-based strategy game by NCS and conversion of a game originally released for the NEC PC-8801 in 1987. The Light and Dark forces are engaged in a fierce war and Böser, leader of the Dark Army, is now ready to capture the Rall Tower, source of the world's energy. Sieghart, leader of the Light army, is the only one who stands between the evil Böser and the complete decimation of the kingdom. Gaia no Monsh? is a turn-based strategy game at heart - the player moves troops around a battlefield and attacks nearby enemy units. An Auto Battle mode is also available and gives the option to let the AI figure out of the player's next move. The game offers several play modes - the first one (Scenario Mode) gives the player the chance to jump straight into battle using predefined troops. The second (Construction Mode) allows him to build his own army using unit points. The last one (Campaign Mode) conveys story plot elements and starts in the siege town of Dirl, where king Sieghart battles the fierce Böser. This mode requires more complex strategy and the player must assemble his own troops using unit points and units lost in battle don't come back during the campaign. Unlike the other two modes, it offers a password system to save the player's progress through the game.</desc>

    <name>Galaga '88</name>
    <desc>Galaga '88 takes the basic gameplay of Galaga and adds higher-quality graphics, triple ship abilities, parsec progression, power-ups, asteroids, bosses and other enhancements. Periodically the player encounters Challenging Stages, which are set to music and feature "dancing" enemies.  The objective is to shoot all 40 enemies before they disappear, for a bonus of at least 10,000 points. There are a total of 29 stages. The player can begin with one ship with two in reserve or start right out with a dual ship (but only one in reserve).   
 
Some enemies now have the ability to combine into a much larger single enemy that takes multiple shots to destroy. Others explode in a brilliant shower of fireworks when destroyed, and occasionally these enemies drop a small formation of much smaller enemies that "wiggle" their way down the screen.  Some enemies arrive in spherical "eggs" and emit a loud, high-pitched noise when hit. These creatures take multiple hits to destroy in flight (just one hit in formation), and their main attack pattern is to move about halfway down the screen, stop, fire multiple shots at once, and then fly straight down off the bottom of the screen.  Another type of enemy takes at least five hits to destroy, and it grows larger with each consecutive hit, making it both a larger target and allowing it to act as a shield to other enemies.  
 
Later in the game some enemies are equipped with armor that renders them invincible while in formation. When one of these enemies starts its dive, it will flip over and expose its vulnerable side, then flip over again and become invincible while it moves back up the screen, then flip one more time and finish its dive. While vulnerable, this enemy can be destroyed in one hit, scoring bonus points. In addition, many different kinds of obstacles appear throughout the game, including blue crystals, boulders and green blobs.</desc>

When they plot to attack the city she transforms into a super-villainess called "Onyomiko". The battles of Agedaman and Onyomiko began!</desc>

    <desc>Gomola Speed is an action game featuring a robot snake. You must find the pieces of your body strewn about each maze-like stage, which increase your size, and use your length to surround items, food, and enemies in order to eliminate them. You can also use bombs to stun more dangerous enemies.

Different stages may have different goals -- for example, you may have to find a key, or use your surround ability on floor tiles to reveal items or enemies. Only your snake's head is vulnerable; if an enemy hits your body it will scatter all the pieces and you'll have to collect them again. After completing set conditions on each stage, a door will open that leads to the next stage, at which point you'll be just a head again, and will have to hunt for your body once more.

The game has the same unique UPL style that will be familiar to fans of games such as Atomic Robo-Kid and Mutant Night.</desc>

    <desc>One day, Hani (sometimes known as Honey), who is a phallic objet d'art from stoneage Japan, is summoned by the god Izanaki. Izanaki is worried because his wife Izanami's heart has been invaded by a demon. His once peaceful wife now kills thousands of humans each day and threatens to destroy the world that she once created together with her husband. Hani must fly into Izanami's heart and destroy the demon. 
 
Once Hani has entered Izanami's heart, and you are put in control, it turns into a vertically-scrolling shoot'em up. One button fire the gun, but the other one rotates the gun clockwise, so that you may shoot at enemies coming from any direction. Hani is thus reminiscent of a flying tank. Hani starts out with only one life to spare and a weak weapon, usually giving few minutes of play before game over. However, each enemy shot gives spiritual power to Hani. Pressing the run button puts you in contact with Izanaki, who will let you trade in those power points in exchange for the usual assortment of power-ups, such as multiple shots. Izanaki will also grant you teleportation abilities, so that you may travel back and forth between levels.</desc>

To ensure victory, the Gods had to sacrifice part of their divine nature, and forge a weapon that had both good and bad in it - the "Evil Holy Sword" Necromancer. The demons were forced to dwell in the lower world, while the Gods remained in the heaven. Between these two worlds lies the world of humans. But the demons did not accept this plan for co-existence. They have murdered the king of the human continent Ishumeria, and it's time for the nameless hero of this story to seek out the legendary sword Necromancer, and restore balance in the world.</desc>

Both cyborgs have traded their energy blades for ranged attacks, which change the pacing of the game a bit but nevertheless remains an action-oriented side-scrolling platformer in which your objective is to clear the stage of all enemies and bosses, while picking up any power-ups that can aid you in your quest. The game makes a linear progression from stage to stage, losing the world map from the original as well as the upgrade buying between levels (since "Doc" the inventor of both cyborgs and provider of upgrades has been abducted by the aliens), although new shooter stages have been included to spice things up.</desc>

Your partner doesn't like this one bit, so he decides to make a nuisance of himself along the way. Similar to Adventure Island, you must make your way through several levels, destroying wildlife along the way, but instead of using a hammer, you have three different ways to kill them: jump on or kick them, or when they are walking on the ground, blow gas out of them. 

While scrolling through the level, your vitality will decrease, but it can be restored by collecting fruit and junk food. During your travels, you will also encounter your partner doing things that shouldn't be done in public, but sometimes, he will throw stuff at you to make you lose some of your vitality. The only way that you can deal with him is by kicking him where it hurts.

Along the way, you can enter doors. Doing this will give you a hint about the level and your vitality will be increased as well. You can kick certain objects such as lamp posts, trashcans, or thin air to obtain coins, or to make hidden platforms appear. Coins can be used in slot machines that will give you extra vitality, more lives, extra coins, and more. Slot machines only appear when you enter certain doors.</desc>

    <name>Lady Sword: Ryakudatsusareta 10-nin no Otome</name>
    <desc>In this game, the player takes control of a young nameless traveler. One day, the hero meets a man who tells him a sad story: monsters have kidnapped his granddaughter, and locked her away in a tower. Apparently, the monsters also took away nine other young girls, and have some evil plans in mind. The hero agrees to venture into the tower's labyrinth and succeed where no other adventurer could... 
 
Lady Sword is a first-person solo dungeon crawler. The player navigates the hero through the complex, maze-like corridors of the tower (with an auto-map feature), trying to find the right way to the stairs to the next floor. Fake walls, teleporters, one-way doors, items that must be collected to unlock hidden passages, boss enemies, etc., are there to make this task harder than it looks. Regular enemies pop out randomly, and must be defeated in a very simple turn-based combat.  
 
There is no damage feedback for the hero (though the player can see exactly how badly the hero himself is hurt), no weapons, armor, or items for combat usage. The player can heal the hero's wounds by selecting "sleep" from the menu. Sleeping restores the hero to full HP; but if he rests too much, a tough demon will appear and attack. 
 
Character growth is handled via direct stat increasing; there are no "levels", and the hero's HP, attack and defense power, as well as agility, increase gradually the more he fights. 
 
On each floor, a digitized photo of a young woman will greet the hero and encourage the player to explore further - at the stairs to the next floor, should the hero overcome all the obstacles, the player will be able to see the girl naked.</desc>

Getting power-ups will make the fireball soon increase to a bouncing fireball, which will deal more damage to enemies. Treasure chests can be busted open, allowing Tommy to collect coins. Tommy's journey will have him explore ruins, cliffs, statues, dungeons, and finally the castle. At the end of each level, there is a boss that must be defeated in order to proceed to the next stage.</desc>

    <name>Lode Runner : Lost Labyrinth</name>
    <desc>Lode Runner: Lost Labyrinth is an exact conversion of the original Lode Runner. However, this version features one hundred levels which mostly differ from the original ones. Another difference is that the levels scroll. 
 
This is a platformer in which the protagonist needs to collect all gold which is spread out over the levels. Unfortunately there are a lot of enemies roaming around which should be avoided. The protagonist can't jump and so he needs to resort to ladders and horizontal ropes for dodging. The only way to temporarily get rid of a guard is to make a hole in the ground where they can't get out when falling in. After a certain amount of time a hole is filled up and a trapped guard respawns.</desc>

    <name>Maerchen Maze</name>
    <desc>Märchen Maze is a platform/shooter game and conversion of Namco's 1988 arcade game of the same name. The gameplay remains largely the same - the player takes control of Alice who must shoot bubbles at enemies to knock them off platforms. Unlike the arcade original which was in isometric perspective, Märchen Maze on the PC Engine is an overhead game. This version features different stages than the arcade game, and because of the lack of a time limit, many of the stages are much more expansive. The chequered platforms at the end of a level are static rather than moving, hopping on to them automatically takes you to the boss. Also, instead of starting from a checkpoint when you die, your lives are represented by balloons. Should Alice fall, you'll be respawned on the spot.</desc>

    <desc>The story of this game is loosely based on the 19th century Japanese epic novel Nans? Satomi Hakkenden ("Tale of Eight Dogs") by Kyokutei Bakin. In the game, the player controls a young warrior named Shin. The elder of his home village tells him that a magical artifact known as the Statue of the Four Gods has been stolen. This artifact was sealing away the spirit of the evil Tamazusa. To prevent Tamazusa's resurrection, Shin must find seven other warriors. Only when they are united can the evil be defeated once and for all... 
 
Despite the premise of eight warriors, Makai Hakkenden Shada is an action RPG in which the player controls only Shin. The game is similar to the better-known  Ys games in many ways. As in Ys, the hero fights enemies simply by "bumping" into them. Defeated enemies produce money, which can be spent in villages to purchase weapons and various types of armor, and experience points. Once a set amount of those is accumulated, the hero gains a level. 
 
Later in the game Shin receives spells and special techniques, which must be executed actively, by pressing a button. There is also a "search" command in the game, which is required to use to solve certain situations.</desc>

    <desc>Moto Roader II is a racing game shown in a top-down perspective. Five vehicles compete on a course with the goal to finish first. However, the screen always follows the leading vehicle and if a vehicle is left behind, it gets replaced on the current screen. Every vehicle has a fuel counter which gets a penalty if the vehicle is hit or needs to be replaced. Reaching zero ends the race. Players can choose between three vehicles which drive differently (car, tank or hovercraft) and, if they have gathered enough prize money, can upgrade it between races (including weapons). In contrast to the predecessor, the game has a futuristic look.</desc>

Before each race you can buy a full compliment of upgrades and weapons, with each area (engine, handling, turbo and so on) having several variably-priced options. The unusual thing about the racing system is that the action always follows the leader. If you slip too far behind, your car is blown up and placed back onto the track further on in order to keep up (similarly to Micro Machines). This can only happen a limited number of times before the game is over.</desc>

It is based on the toyline of the same name, which was one of many brands of "shokugan" or "food toys" - small figurines packaged with candy that were intended for children. The toyline featured the evil sorcerer Neclos/Necros, the eight heroic champions sent to defeat him and Neclos/Necros's various henchmonsters. 
 
The game controls like a standard RPG and alternates between a top-down view for talking to NPCs and exploring towns and dungeons and a first-person view for its turn-based combat. The various characters launch into little animated vignettes whenever they attack, and each of the heroes has strengths and weaknesses specific to their class which the player can build strategies around.</desc>

    <desc>Military Madness is a futuristic turn-based strategy war game.  The year is 2089 and the setting is Earth?s moon, which yields many important resources.  While the governments of Earth bicker over their staked claims on the moon, the evil Axis Empire launches a lunar military campaign and takes over the moon, using its factories to produce advanced weaponry, the most devastating of which is the SAM (Supreme Atomic Missile).  As commander of the Allied forces, it is the player?s responsibility to lead what?s left of the Allied armies in a desperate offensive against the Axis Empire on the lunar surface before they can use the SAM to destroy Earth. 
 
There are 32 maps (2 different campaigns with 16 maps each) to play through.  In each map, the player must strategically defeat the outnumbering Axis forces either by destroying all enemy units or capturing the enemy base camp.  There are many different units that both sides utilize - infantry, tanks, aircraft, artillery, and a few others that have specialized functions.  Gameplay consists of moving units into positions that will gain the best advantage to attack the enemy, capitalizing on many factors, which include battle experience, terrain, support tactics, and - sometimes - pure luck.</desc>

But there are still monsters roaming the countryside, and some of them were spotted near Yurius Shrine. Jazeta went there to find out what exactly had happened. But he didn't return... You are Jazeta's son, and you must first of all find your missing father! Can it be that the shadow of Emperor of Darkness threatens the peaceful land again?..

The sequel to "Neutopia" is similar to the predecessor in every way. Navigating your hero from a top-down view, you explore the vast countryside, fighting monsters in real time combat. The game is not a true RPG, but an action adventure: you don't gain any experience points from combat, only collect money to buy supplies. In dungeons, you must use bombs on walls to reveal secret passages, push stones, and fight many regular enemies and bosses.</desc>

Dungeons also require some puzzle-solving (pushing stones, blowing walls with bombs, etc.). The game has a slight RPG flavor, allowing the player to power-up by collecting various items, and equip different weapons and armor.</desc>

Operation Wolf is an arcade game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds.  
 
You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial.  
 
Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit. </desc>

    <desc>A very important discovery was recently made on the planet Laffra - ancient ruins at an excavation site, containing relics of another civilization, with technique that would surely benefit the great intergalactic Empire. But a mysterious organization that calls itself Mars began to stir unrest on the planet. The head of Imperial Scouts sends the hero, piloting a combat robot known as FW, into the depths of the ruins, to face the enemies and retrieve the precious knowledge... 
 
Out Live is a solo dungeon crawler; unlike most representatives of this genre, it is set in a sci-fi environment, and the player controls a giant robot rather than a medieval warrior. Most of the enemies are also machines and robots of different kinds. 
 
Before venturing into the dungeon, the player has access to various shops, where it is possible to repair the robot, buy weapons, protective shields, and items that restore the robot's energy. Most of the gameplay takes place in pseudo-3D, maze like underground complexes (without an auto-map, but with a compass feature). There, the game plays similarly to other dungeon crawlers: random enemies must be fought in turn-based fashion; they drop money and award the player character with experience points. 
 
A somewhat unusual feature is double leveling: the robot has two independent levels, for attack and for defense. The experience points the robot receives after battles also come in two different flavors. Depending on the enemy type and outcome of the battle, the robot receives different amounts of experience. The leveling-up itself is automatic, increasing maximum energy, attack and defense parameters.</desc>

    <desc>Brace yourself for the most realistic racing experience yet. And to play, you've got to have what it takes: NERVE, SKILL and BRAINS. NERVE - you're behind the wheel of a supertuned race car with one speed only: fast. SKILL - you're maneuvering a car that can nearly reach a simulated 270 KMH. BRAINS - because you're in control of your car's speed and handling at a dangerous pace, you have to use your head and not just your hands to survive. So get geared for the ride of your life and stay alert. The track may look terrific, but at these speeds anything can turn into a danger zone.</desc>

    <name>Override</name>
    <desc>Override is a vertically-scrolling shooter in which the player controls a fighter craft on a mission to stop an alien invasion of the Earth. Much of the action takes place on planet surfaces, and enemies include spaceships of various kinds as well as ground enemies, mobile (tanks) or stationary (turrets). The player-controlled craft begins with two lives with three hit points each; restoring power-ups can repair the plane or increase its number of lives. 

Other power-ups come in two varieties: strength-increasing or secondary weapons. Depending on the color, the latter grants the plane wingmen with laser attacks, spreading fire, side lasers, rotating energy balls, etc. The strength of secondary weapons can be increase by flying over strength-increasing power-ups as well. Special weapon that hurts all enemies on screen must be activated by charging, which is achieved by not pressing the fire button for a certain amount of time.</desc>

Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss.  
 
There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

Thankfully your mind has created the ultimate weapon: a ship with which you can navigate the five causes (stages) and blast back the Devil's evil minions. It is your only hope, your one last chance to free your mind from this evil influence.

Psychosis is a side-scrolling shooter where each level is meant to represent a different location within your mind. One looks like the sky, another filled with aquatic plants, one with what resemble tetris blocks. It is within these stages that you must blast everything in sight while collecting power ups to upgrade your weapon and shield. You can gain two floating balls that resemble mechanical eyes and can be directed 360 degrees around your ship to either act as a shield or to direct your weapon. Battle your way through each stage and defeat the boss at the end and eventually you'll do battle against the very DEVIL himself.</desc>

    <desc>The little and bald prehistoric fellow is back and eager to fight once more, but this time no head-kicking nor bare-teeth hill climbing. PC Denjin is a crazy shooter stuffed with wacky and insane action. Our hero character is somehow very different too - this time he is a flying sunglass-wearing cyborg who fights his way through five intense levels. He is also not alone to face the challenges ahead and the army of minions the evil King Droll sends agains him - he is accompanied by new friends, from a massive robot-rocket to a flying mummy and a big and round floating cow. Smilies and power-ups can of course be collected throughout the game and a special and large sunglass-wearing smiley can call one of PC Denjin's friend to the rescue. But this is not all, if he collects the same kind of smiley twice, then they'll both do a mind-blowing mega-fusion. Freaky stuff. On top of being able to use a large selection of weapons, the player can also charge them up at any time by holding the fire button. Wait too long, and PC Denjin over-heats and drops a huge sunglass-wearing purple poo-poo that explodes and causes a fair amount of damage to all nearby enemies.</desc>

    <desc>You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest.  To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.

Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on.  The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high-ground. 

And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.</desc>

    <desc>World Class Baseball is a baseball game. The player controls the pitcher and fielders (through an automatic system that, following baseball games' tradition, gives to him control on the one of the players who is closest to the ball); not the batter. One or two little windows display the runner's status during the face-off between the batter and the pitcher; once the ball is hit the view changes to a bird's eye one, showing a good portion of the game field where the action is taking place, together with a permanent small field's image at the right bottom of the screen displaying the position of every player on the whole field.</desc>

    <desc>Space year X2981Y. Earth has developed battle androids to fight bloodless wars. A new battle android called "Aura" was developed and sent into battle, and seemed to be leading its country to victory. However, Aura broke free of human control and revolted against the Earth, taking control of the other androids and starting a war against humanity. In a last ditch effort, humanity developed one more android, stronger than any before and imbued with the wishes of humanity, dubbed "Psycho Chaser." It is making its assault on Aura's stronghold to end the war. 
 
Psycho Chaser is a vertically-scrolling sci-fi shooter. The player takes control of the titular battle android. There are multiple weapons which can be picked up and freely switched between, and also power-ups which allow for weapon and energy upgrades between stages.</desc>

    <desc>Puzzle Boy is a port of the Game Boy title Kwirk, but features more and different levels along with changed graphics. In contrast to the original version, the perspective is straight top-down and there is no undo-function. 
 
However, regarding gameplay this is still a Soko-Ban variant. The player finds himself in a maze and needs to find the way to the exit. The obstacles on the way are boxes which can be pushed but not pulled, holes and revolving doors. The game features three playing modes, most notably the level mode with 100 levels. They are divided over four sets of 20 each. Those sets have a difficulty level associated with them and each rewards the same ending when solved. The other two modes are the challenge mode (solving ten levels in a limited amount of time) and a split-screen multiplayer mode.</desc>

    <name>Puzznic</name>
    <desc>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</desc>

You start the game with several bombs which you can use to destroy most enemies on the screen to get yourself out of a jam. Each level ends with a large boss or bosses.</desc>

    <desc>Three girls have been reported missing including the mayor's daughter, and Chase Special Investigations has asked you to track down five vehicles, mentioned in the mission briefing, who are believed to be involved in the kidnapping. Using a heavy-designed machine with a V6 DOHC 3000CC Twin Turbo Engine, five sets of nitro-fuel boosts, and a gun attached to the steering wheel (which you can use to damage the target vehicle), your mission is to patrol the streets and find these vehicles. 
 
The gameplay is similar to Chase H.Q., but there are a few differences. For example, cars travel in both directions instead of one, and some of them will catch up to your car and shoot at you. At least once in every stage a helicopter does a fly by and drops you some grenades you can use to further damage the target vehicle. A guy on a motorcycle will catch up to you and throw grenades at your car. And, most importantly, as mentioned earlier, you can shoot at the target vehicle rather than just bumping into it. 
 
Have fun driving around, but remember, there is a strict time limit, so I wouldn't waste time or keep crashing into things if I were you.</desc>

(natto is a regional Japanese dish) and a chef-like spy determined to stop them. Several allusions to the 007 franchise are made throughout the game, including an opening cutscene viewed from the barrel of a gun and the hero casually tossing his hat onto a hat rack as the game begins. 
 
Besides the odd narrative elements, it plays much like any Portopia-derived adventure game: The player can interact with their environment through a list of commands on the right side of the screen and the goal is to talk to NPCs, explore the surroundings and discover clues in order to solve a mystery.</desc>

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side. 
 
This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</desc>

    <desc>Similarly to the original MSX release, guns require ammunition, battles have backgrounds, several enemies may attack at once, and it is possible to leave the side-scrolling battle area by walking to its edge. However, map layout and locations are almost identical with those of the PC-88 version, hence being completely different from those of the MSX release. 
The most significant change - which is unique to this version - is the addition of a RPG system. Whereas in the two other versions the battles didn't serve any other purpose but challenge the player and impede the progress of the story, in the PC Engine release they are essential to Laila's character growth. Like in most RPGs, Laila can now gain levels, which enhance her parameters and make her stronger in combat. When defeated, enemies leave orbs of various colors and chests; these serve to heal Laila, grant her experience points, "mind points" , or ammunition for the firearms.</desc>

    <desc>The setting and the story of Sindibad: Chitei no Daimaky is inspired by the popular stories from the 1001 Nights, though it does not follow any of them specifically, but rather uses popular names and brings together various heroes that had nothing to do with each other in the original stories. The titular character (more commonly spelled Sinbad in English) is a young boy who lives together with his father Alibaba and dreams of marrying the king's daughter Scheherazade. One night, they find out that the princess has been kidnapped; whoever rescues her receives a big prize and Scheherazade herself as a wife! Without further delay, Sindibad and Alibaba begin the perilous journey... 
 
The game is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with all the common ingredients of the genre: the player navigates Sindibad's party over a top-down world map, visiting towns and dungeons (represented as icons), fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, receiving money and experience points, buying better weapons and armor, leveling up automatically, and advancing the story in a linear fashion.</desc>

Skweek can move in each of the four compass directions, and is armed with a simple weapon, whose shots rebound around before they hit one of Pitark's minions, the Schnoreuls - contact with which is instantly fatal. Some squares contain arrows which force you in a particular direction, while there are also blockades to avoid. Bomb squares blow up surrounding squares but give you time to move away from them as they do this, while Shortcut squares allow you to move to another teleport-type square by pushing the joystick in its direction.</desc>

    <desc>Super Momotarou Dentetsu II is the second "Super" game in the long-running Momotarou Dentetsu series and the third overall. It was the first game in the series to be released on the Super Famicom: both Momotarou Dentetsu and Super Momotarou Dentetsu were Famicom games (though the latter was also released on the PC Engine and Game Boy, like Dentetsu II). 
 
The games focus on each player's burgeoning real estate corporation, allowing the players to take turns and move their trains around the board to buy properties and trade resources. It plays similarly to the Parker Brothers board game Monopoly or the Itadaki Street games.</desc>

    <desc>Super Momotarou Dentetsu is a train and conveyance-based board game with financial elements that features Hudson's Momotarou character, based on the Japanese folklore hero of the same name. It is the second game in the Momotarou Dentetsu series and the first to be released on a 16-bit console - the PC Engine - hence the "Super" in the title. Several years after its PC Engine release, Super Momotarou Detetsu was also released on the Nintendo Famicom and Game Boy. It received a sequel in Super Momotarou Dentetsu II and a large number of successors. 
 
The goal of the game is to travel the map and acquire territory through business deals, similar to Monopoly or Itadaki Street. Players have to contend with each other for limited resources, as well as CPU threats like the God of Poverty.</desc>

    <desc>Super Volleyball is an indoor volleyball game for one or two players. The single player mode offers two game options: normal game and World League. Choosing normal game pits the player against the computer in a single game. Choosing World League pits the player against all other teams available. A password save is available in this mode.

The game features eight national teams (USA, USSR, Brazil, Holland, France, Italy, Japan and China), with fictitiously named players. Players can be changed during gameplay by pressing C. There is also an option to create new teams, choosing the team's name, color, player's position and names.

Gameplay is viewed from a side scrolling perspective, with the camera fixed on the ball. A small radar on the top of the screen shows the players' positions of both teams. Players can, bump, set, spike, dump, block and dig. A collection of serves is also available: underhand, overhand and jump serve. There are also options for three ball speeds, beginning points (from 0 to 10, out of 15) and handicap.</desc>

    <path>./Susanoo Densetsu (Japan).pce</path>
    <name>Susanoou Densetsu</name>
    <desc>The game is based on the eponymous manga (sometimes transliterated as Susa no Oh) by  Go Nagai. The protagonist is a seemingly ordinary teenager named Susa, who discovers that he contains within himself another persona, the destructive Japanese god Susanoo. The game's story begins right where the manga ended (with a cliffhanger): Susa faces his rival Uryu, who causes him to unleash the power of Susanoo, devastating the world and releasing evil spirits that take it in their possession. Having returned to his normal self, Susa has to find his sweetheart Yukishiro and other friends, and figure out a way to undo the damage he has inflicted on the world. 
 
Susano? Densetsu is notable for implementing a setting and gameplay themes unusual for Japanese RPGs of its time. Among those is a day/night cycle, which influences the appearance of monsters on the world map as well as schedules of characters in the towns (for example, shops are closed at night). It is also one of the first Japanese RPGs in which enemies wander around visibly on the world map, sometimes surrounding the player,  Ultima-style, and can be avoided. 
 
The battle system is also reminiscent of Ultima, featuring free movement on the top-down battle screen. The fights are held in fast-paced turn-based style; to pause the fight, the player has to bring up the menu and select a command. Similarly to  Emerald Dragon, action points are spent when moving and/or selecting commands. 
 
Later in the game Susa teams up with two other characters; he can also recruit mercenaries to help him in battles. Characters learn the so-called "ESP powers" when leveling up, which are equivalent to magic spells.</desc>

You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 
 
However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".</desc>

    <name>The New Zealand Story</name>
    <desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook.  
 
If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs.  
 
In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.

    <name>Titan</name>
    <desc>Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid.

For some reason, mad professors of the future tend to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor Hybrys’ variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.

The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key – a very useful option in tricky situations.

Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.</desc>

    <name>Toy Shop Boys</name>
    <desc>Toy Shop Boys is a vertical shoot 'em up exclusive to the PC Engine. It features three kids - the titular Toy Shop Boys - who fight to recover their toys from a villain named Gamma. 
 
The player can switch between the three at any time: the kid in the red cap fires a straightforward shot that will branch out into a spreadshot when upgraded; the kid in the yellow cap fires boomerangs which home in on enemies on the screen, with power-ups increasing the number fired at once; the kid in the blue cap swings around a lightsaber that catches projectiles and works as a close-range weapon. 
 
Most of the game's enemies are toy based: a giant cymbal monkey, for instance, or a pair of toy Formula 1 cars.</desc>

    <desc>Tricky Kick is a sliding block puzzle game for the TurboGrafix-16.

You have to kick two of the same item together, and they disappear, until you clear the board of pieces. You can 
bump one item with another unless the way is blocked.

There are also enemies that you have to kick into bumpers to destroy them.

The game has a regular mode and a special mode with 60 puzzles each.  Many of the puzzles are quite difficult even in regular mode.</desc>

    <desc>Basketball was the second sport to which Cinemaware applied their philosophy of lavish production and advanced cutscenes. Exhibition and league matches are on offer, with the opportunity to recreate a full league season with 1 player assigned to each of the 28 clubs. The game uses varying camera positions, with top-down views when the ball is close to either hoop, and a side-view when the ball is mid-court - controls remain unchanged for these, so the switch doesn't cause a sudden change in player movement. 
 
As well as playing the matches you have full coaching control. This can involve making substitutions but also assigning marking and game strategies.</desc>

    <desc>Before Electronic Arts sought to imitate television coverage of sports with their EA Sports titles, Cinemaware had the same idea, initially applying it to (American) Football. Cutscenes follow dramatic moments in the match, and each match is preceded by a TV-style introduction. The game is primarily action-based, although you also choose your plays before executing them. You then bring the passes and runs to life on the pitch itself. You can play single matches or full leagues, with any of the NFL teams of the time.</desc>

    <name>TV Sports Hockey</name>
    <desc>Cinemaware's TV Sports series got an exclusive entry on the TurboGrafx-16 with this hockey game. 
 
The game offers exhibition matches and a tournament mode, eight international teams (each with unique player statistics), and support for up two five players via the TurboTap. 
 
After a dramatic close-up of the face-off, actual game play is seen from a top-down perspective with a vertically scrolling field. Every player (including the goalie) can be controlled. On offense, quick shots, slap shots and even faked slap shots are possible. On defense, body checking an opposing player can lead to a special fight sequence. 
 
Exhibition games can be played with either full or easy rules - easy mode has less penalties and infractions like offside. In tournaments, every scheduled game can either be played or the results simulated. Tournament progress is saved via a password. When two or more players play, they can be put on any team. Thus teams featuring five human players are just as possible as mixed competitive matches.</desc>

    <desc>Takin' it to the Hoop is a basketball game with comic graphics. The player either participates in a league, play-offs or a single match and chooses one of eight American teams with twelve athletes. The team's performance during a match does not only depend on the player's ability but also on the athlethe's statistics (e.g. agility or dribbling) and their energy. Energy decreases during the course of a match and describes how much power an athlete has left. There are also three different defense tactics (one-on-one defense, zone defense or a mix between the two) which can be set before the match or during interceptions. 
 
During the matches, the player controls the ball carrier when in offense and manually switches between athletes when in defense. Passes can be performed in a high or low variation. While most of the match is shown in a slightly heightened side-scrolling perspective, the game switches to a close-up view during a penalty throw or a dunking try. Here the player needs to press a button at the correct timing for a successful throw. When a defense athlete is nearby during a during maneuver, he has the opportunity to block the ball when the correct timing is met.</desc>

    <name>Volfied</name>
    <desc>Volfied is a home conversion of an arcade coin-op developed by Taito in the late '80s. The game is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along.

The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points.

As an arcade conversion this game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.</desc>

Not only must you clear the enemies of each stage, but also please the crowd with your performances, being wary of perverts that attempt to take pictures of your underwear whenever you attack (Momo shows quite a bit of leg whenever she "kicks high") which results in blinding flashes that stun Momo and leave her open to an attack.</desc>

    <name>Xevious : Fardraut Saga</name>
    <desc>Xevious: Fardraut Densetsu, despite sharing its name with Xevious: Fardraut Saga (Fardraut Densetsu in Japanese), can be considered a sequel to that game. The humans' battle against the bio-computer GAMP continues, with new pilots rising to the challenge and doing their best to protect the Earth. 
 
The game consists of two modes, entitled Arcade and Fardraut. The Arcade mode is the same as the Recon mode in Xevious: Fardraut Saga, being a port of the original arcade Xevious. The Fardraut mode is composed of four stages, featuring familiar South American backgrounds. Unlike most Xevious games, the player takes control of the aircraft Solvalou only in the third stage; the first two ones are played controlling two different, smaller ships, each possessing properties similar to the Solvalou: rapid fire against air enemies, and bombs dropped on ground structures.</desc>

    <name>Yuu Yuu Jinsei : Victory Life</name>
    <desc>Yuu Yuu Jinsei, or Victory Life, is a board game simulation which shares more than a few similarities to Milton Bradley's The Game of Life, not least of which include the automobile player pieces and the player's journey through various stages of life via a series of randomly occurring events. The game is actually licensed to Takara, the Japanese publisher of the board game (who would also create a few Game of Life video games of their own). 
 
The goal is to make it to retirement with the most assets. The player can also get married, have kids and experience various other important life changes, but the primary goal is the acquisition of funds. The player is also able to invest funds and gamble, the outcome of which is dependent on pure luck.</desc>

    <path>./Zipang (Japan).pce</path>
    <name>Zipang</name>
    <desc>Zipang is a puzzle game released exclusively for the PC Engine in 1990. It is based on the movie of the same name (which in turn is an antiquated word for the nation of Japan): a comedy action movie from director Kaizo Hayashi that was loosely based on Japanese mythology and was also released in 1990. The same movie would also be the inspiration for the NES game Kabuki Quantum Fighter, which in Japan was named Jigoku Gokurakumaru: the name of the movie's protagonist. 
 
Zipang plays similarly to Solomon's Key/Solomon no Kagi by Tecmo. The player character can destroy and place blocks, using them as platforms to get higher up in the stage. The player needs to remove enemies in their way and collect necessary items along the way to the exit. After each stage, a prefecture of Japan is placed on a map of Japan: upon completing them all, the game is over.</desc>
