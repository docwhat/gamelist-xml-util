    <desc>This version of Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous ` +
		`block-stacking game, and was included with the Game Boy upon its ` +
		`release in several territories. The goal is to place pieces made ` +
		`up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into ` +
		`complete rows, which then disappear. As rows are cleared, the ` +
		`pace of the game increases and the background changes, and the ` +
		`game ends if the stack reaches the top of the well.` +
		"\n\n" +
		`The game is very similar to Nintendo's own NES version of the game, ` +
		`featuring the same "Type A" endless and "Type B" set-clear modes. The ` +
		`game also features a 2-player versus mode that can be played with two ` +
		`Game Boys, two copies of Tetris, and a Game Boy link cable. Clearing ` +
		`lines in this mode will cause the other player's stack to rise, with ` +
		`the goal being to make the other player lose.</desc>
